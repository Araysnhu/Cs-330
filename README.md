*How do I approach designing software?
Through working on this project, I've developed several new design skills, particularly in 3D scene composition and object modeling. My process involved breaking down complex objects—like the two different bottles and the dumbbell—into their basic geometric primitives. This deconstructive design approach allowed me to focus on each component individually before assembling them into a coherent whole. For example, I modeled the first bottle as a prism body, a pyramid top, and a cylinder cap. Similarly, the dumbbell was built from a cylinder handle and two spheres as weights. This tactic of simplifying complex visuals into basic shapes is a valuable skill that I can apply to future projects, whether they involve 3D graphics, game development, or even user interface design, as it helps in creating clean, modular designs.
*How do I approach developing programs?
First, I added the first object, the rectangular prism bottle, and refined its size and placement. Each new object, such as the second bottle and the dumbbell, was added in a separate development cycle, allowing me to test and adjust its scale, position, and texture without disrupting the entire scene. This process of building the scene piece by piece was crucial. It enabled me to continuously evaluate my progress and make small, manageable changes. My approach to developing code has evolved from a linear, "write-all-at-once" style to a more modular and iterative process. I now understand the importance of testing each component as it's built, which reduces the complexity of debugging and makes it easier to manage large-scale projects. This iterative strategy is now a core part of my development workflow.
*How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Working with computational graphics and visualizations has provided me with valuable knowledge and skills that I can apply to both my future educational and professional pathways. Academically, this experience has solidified my understanding of linear algebra concepts like transformations (scaling, rotation, translation), which are fundamental to computer graphics and various other fields of computer science, including data science and machine learning. Professionally, the ability to translate complex data into visual representations is a highly sought-after skill. Whether it's creating detailed 3D models for product design, developing interactive visualizations for scientific research, or building user interfaces, these skills in computational graphics allow me to communicate information in a clear and engaging manner. This project has not only enhanced my technical abilities but also taught me to think creatively about problem-solving and visual communication, which are essential for a career in any technology-driven field.
